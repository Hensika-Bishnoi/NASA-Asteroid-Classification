# NASA-Asteroid-Classification

This project focuses on classifying NASA-recorded asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous using various machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and others. By leveraging data from NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) program, the project aims to identify potential threats from asteroids, thereby contributing to planetary defense efforts.
